<h1>Introduction to Redstone Engineering.</h1> 
<p>Redstone has many uses. The basics of redstone are simple. Wires that connect to lights, doors, pistons, trapdoors, or perhaps they connect to a repeater, which will extend its connection reach. 
Redstone can be found underground. As of right now, the version is 1.16. The 1.17 version of Minecraft will come out soon, so it will be different from now, but it will stay the same in the way that redstone will be found deep underground.</p>
<h1>Redstone Door</h1>
<p>A redstone door can be used to hide your base from greedy thieves in a multiplayer world. They often will run around looking for bases, and quietly take a few items from you, like iron, wood, stone, leather, and if you’re not hiding your wealth at all, more expensive resources. You can counter this with two methods. One, be online often. This can be a problem for some people, as expected. Minecraft is not a full time job. Unless you’re a Minecraft streamer or a youtuber.</p>

<p>First, make this design. The cobblestone blocks will be the door.</p>

<p>Next, make the redstone wiring. It should look like this. Remember to place redstone torches below the surface, directly under the first redstone torches you placed.</p>

<p>Once you place the redstone down under the surface, place two pressure plates down, directly above the unlit redstone connection.</p>

<p>For the exit, place blocks like so, connecting with the first unlit redstone connection, this redstone connection will be able to activate the pistons from the other side of the door.</p>

<p>Finally, cover the redstone connection up.</p>
<h1>Redstone Automatic Farm</h1>
<p>Good, now you have finished a hidden redstone door. Pat yourself on the back. Redstone isn't limited to only those types of uses though, as we have gone over before. We could make an automatic farm, for example. If you need something to harvest crops faster, 
<h2>Automatic Farm</h2>
<img src="farm1.png" width="600" height="400">
<p>Start with an 8x8 square of dirt, 1 block above the ground.</p>
<img src="farm2.png" width="600" height="400">
<p>Next, place a hopper that connects to a chest, with a current from a water source, made like how I made it in the picture. This will push the harvested crops to the hopper.</p>
<img src="farm3.png" width="600" height="400">
<p>Place a second section of dirt, this one being 7x8. Place water inside of the cobblestone to the side, just next to the dirt.</p>
<img src="farm4.png" width="600" height="400">
<p>Make the desired number of layers of farmland. It will likely look something like this. </p>
<img src="farm5.png" width="600" height="400">
<p>At the very back, place a foundation for which you will make the redstone machinery.</p>
<img src="farm6.png" width="600" height="400">
<p>Place the redstone down, with water in the back, and pistons just above them and further to the front. Have a redstone trail that connects them to the front for the lever to activate them.</p>
<img src="farm7.png" width="600" height="400">
<p>The redstone signal will look something like this. Place repeaters frequently so that the signal does not die down as the trail gets longer.</p>
